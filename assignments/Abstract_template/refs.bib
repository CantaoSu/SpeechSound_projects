@article{hanssen_t-bias_2015,
	abstract = {Previous studies reveal that young Dutch children display a [t]-bias in the middle of words in pronunciation (e.g. van der Feest 2007; Kerkhoff 2007). First graders, however, display a 〈d〉-bias in the middle of words in their writings (Neijt \& Schreuder 2007). The present study investigates children's spelling and pronunciation of word medial
              d
              and
              t
              to examine this apparent contrast. It turned out that first graders started with a 〈t〉-bias in their spellings while later on they displayed a 〈d〉-bias. A similar development was found for pronunciation: Kindergartners displayed a [t]-bias, while second graders displayed a [d]-bias instead. Our explanation is that this change is caused by overgeneralization, due to differences between Dutch pronunciation and orthography. We conclude that the orthographic system, although learned later in life, affects children's earlier acquired pronunciation.},

@article{gabriel_vot_2016,
	abstract = {This study addresses the production of Voice Onset Time ({VOT}) in French as a foreign language ({FFL}). The learners are young multilingual learners who speak Mandarin Chinese as a heritage language along with German. To determine potential effects of the learners' multilingual background, these multilingual learners were compared to three control groups: (1) monolingual German learners of {FFL}, (2) monolingual Mandarin Chinese learners of {FFL}, and (3) native speakers of French (L1). In addition, a perception experiment was carried out to find out to what extent the {VOT} values measured in the production data contribute to the perception of foreign accent. Our results show that multilingual learners perform similar to monolingual learners, suggesting that multilingual learners are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged when acquiring the phonology of a foreign language. Furthermore, the learners' perceived accent in the perception data study mirrors the results from the production study.},

	abstract = {Algemeen Beschaafd Nederlands
              (henceforth {ABN}) is a term used generally in the Netherlands by linguists and laymen alike to refer to the country's prestige dialect; a literal translation would be `General Refined Dutch'. Though {ABN} is a
              dialect
              rather than an
              accent
              (Wells, 1970:231), its status is comparable to that of the {RP} accent of English since it is essentially a social variety only loosely associated with a particular geographical area. {ABN} speakers are to be found in greatest numbers throughout the Western provinces (i.e. Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland and Utrecht) and particularly in the annular
              Randstad
              conurbation linking the towns of Rotterdam, The Hague, Amsterdam and Utrecht; but {ABN} is to be heard from the upper socio-economic classes all over the Netherlands, and is also looked to as a standard in the Dutch-speaking regions of Belgium.},

@article{van_alphen_acoustical_2004,
	abstract = {Three experiments investigated the voicing distinction in Dutch initial labial and alveolar plosives. The difference between voiced and voiceless Dutch plosives is generally described in terms of the presence or absence of prevoicing (negative voice onset time). Experiment 1 showed, however, that prevoicing was absent in 25\% of voiced plosive productions across 10 speakers. The production of prevoicing was influenced by place of articulation of the plosive, by whether the plosive occurred in a consonant cluster or not, and by speaker sex. Experiment 2 was a detailed acoustic analysis of the voicing distinction, which identified several acoustic correlates of voicing. Prevoicing appeared to be by far the best predictor. Perceptual classification data revealed that prevoicing was indeed the strongest cue that listeners use when classifying plosives as voiced or voiceless. In the cases where prevoicing was absent, other acoustic cues influenced classification, such that some of these tokens were still perceived as being voiced. These secondary cues were different for the two places of articulation. We discuss the paradox raised by these findings: although prevoicing is the most reliable cue to the voicing distinction for listeners, it is not reliably produced by speakers.},

@article{cho_phonological_2006,
	abstract = {We investigated how listeners of two unrelated languages, Korean and Dutch, process phonologically viable and nonviable consonants spoken in Dutch and American English. To Korean listeners, released final stops are nonviable because word-final stops in Korean are never released in words spoken in isolation, but to Dutch listeners, unreleased word-final stops are nonviable because word-final stops in Dutch are generally released in words spoken in isolation. Two phoneme monitoring experiments showed a phonological effect on both Dutch and English stimuli: Korean listeners detected the unreleased stops more rapidly whereas Dutch listeners detected the released stops more rapidly and/or more accurately. The Koreans, however, detected released stops more accurately than unreleased stops, but only in the non-native language they were familiar with (English). The results suggest that, in non-native speech perception, phonological legitimacy in the native language can be more important than the richness of phonetic information, though familiarity with phonetic detail in the non-native language can also improve listening performance.},

@article{van_sluis_acoustic_nodate,
	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to describe the acoustic changes of the consonants /t/ and /d/ in Dutch speaking individuals before and after total laryngectomy. The speech of seventeen participants was recorded before and after treatment. Eighteen tokens from a read-aloud text were obtained with /t/ or /d/ in initial position. Prevoicing, burst duration and duration of the vowel following the consonant were analyzed. The results show that the acoustic contrast of the /t/ and /d/ in initial position is reduced after treatment. Post-operatively, the presence of prevoicing of /d/ decreases, and burst duration increases. In the post-operative situation, therefore, /d/ becomes more similar to /t/ acoustically.},
