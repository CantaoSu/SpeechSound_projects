\section{Lab Book A3.}
In the Lab Book A3 we are focusing on spectral features of our speech signals. To examine these we are going to use \href{https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/}{Praat}. 

\subsection{Submission}
For this submission you will need to commit LaTeX file as usual and together with your commit link upload the following 2 files to the  Brighspace assignment: one multi-channel .wav file and the corresponding .TextGrid file you made in the Assignment 1 (see below).


\begin{problem}{1}
\textbf{[10pts]} \textit{English}: 

\subsubsection*{Preparation:}

Take one of the recording of English version of "North Wind and the Sun" reading from \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16kZBQhEbdeE40Rv_GGGD-JhZfa5eA1fu?usp=sharing}{the folder}. Splice out ("segment")\footnote{Extract both the selected sound and TextGrid by using "time from 0" in the menu.} the first sentence of the "North Wind and the Sun" - \textit{"The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak."} - and annotate it in into words. 

Next, filter the sound object of your first sentence with a low pass filter at 10 kHz. You will be working with this sound in this task.

\subsubsection*{Task:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Split the prepared sound object into 8 equal channels using Hann filter and name the resulted sound objects accordingly (e.g, starting from the lowest frequency band - from 0 Hz to 1250 Hz will be named "ch1", from 1250 Hz to 2500 Hz - "ch2", etc.).
    \item Listen to each channel and examine spectrograms and waveforms of each channel individually\footnote{If your spectrogram only shows frequencies up to 5kHz (the default value), adjust the spectrogram settings in the menu "Spectrum" $=>$ "Settings"}.
    \item Examine each channel by opening ("View \& Edit") it with the corresponding TextGrid file. In your answer name the sounds and the corresponding words that are visible and/or audibly recognizable in the channels 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 (separate list for every channel), and reflect on what you see and hear: share your insights about different types of sounds that you see/hear on each channel.
    \item Combine all 8 channels into a multi-channel recording (select all channels and use "Combine" $=>$ "to stereo") and examine the resulted sound again. Rename the sound as "yourfirstname-wind-s1-selectedaccent.wav" (replace "yourfirstname" with your first name and "selectedaccent" with accent you selected from a folder: e.g., "vass-wind-s1-nz.wav") and save it. Also save the extracted TextGrid to accompany it (good practice is to name TextGrid the same as the original sound file, e.g. "vass-wind-s1-nz.TextGrid" .
\end{itemize}
